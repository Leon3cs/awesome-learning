## Sessions

1.  Session 1. [forEach](forEach)
    -   Learn how to replace `for` loops with `forEach` in many use-cases.
2.  Session 2. [map and filter](filter-&-map)
    -   Learn how to make non-mutating array manipulations with `map` and `filter`.
        `map` is a new functional approach to array iteration that returns a new
        array, and filter gives you the power to create new arrays out of
        elements that meet your criteria.
3.  Session 3. [reduce](reduce)
    -   Learn the array method that can create new arrays, objects, arrays of
        objects, single values, anything. It's one of our most powerful
        functional array methods.
4.  Session 4. [advanced reduce](advanced-reduce)
    -   Deep-dive into `reduce` with a challenging exercise set meant to push the
        boundaries of what reduce can do.
5.  Bonus Session. [sort](sort)
    -   For the curious, learn how to sort complex data sets based on
        user-defined callbacks.
