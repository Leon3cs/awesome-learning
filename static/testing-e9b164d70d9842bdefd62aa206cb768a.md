    write assertions, help you test basic JS functions, and show you why tests can be so helpful. **By the end of this session you
    will be able to write a unit test for a vanilla JS function.** 

2.  [Component testing with Enzyme](component-testing)

    -   This session will show you the basics of testing User Interfaces. You will start with Jest only, learning
    the difference between React Components and Elements. From there, you will add in Enzyme to test component instances and their many variations. **By the end of this session you will be able to write a Jest/Enzyme test for a React component.**
