description: "The focus of this course is to make you familiar with the nuance of the JavaScript Data Types. A little hazy on passing objects by reference? Not sure why your number is coercing to a string? Not sure what coercion is? Then this is the topic for you. Feel at home with the data types and how to make them do what you want by the end of this course"

## Sessions

1. [Session 1 Types and Equality](types-and-equality)

    -   Engineers familiar with strictly typed languages like (C++/Java) may
        find the lack of types in JavaScript shocking. But that is only true on
        the surface, the truth is that JavaScript has several types.
        Understanding how they interact together, what they _mean_ will help
        clear up common misconceptions and make JavaScript seem much more
        predictable.

     - Type safety is a popular topic in modern JavaScript Applications. A
        solid foundation of types in the language opens a door to exploring what
        "type coercion" is, why it exists and how to avoid it entirely. We will
        put everything we learned so far into practice and see how value
        equality is determined in JavaScript.

2.  [Session 2 Objects](objects)

    -   "In JavaScript, **almost** everything is an object" is the phrase which
        will be the topic of conversation. In this session, we will learn what
        this means and how to put this new found knowledge into practice.
